## November Funshop Review

* Review "joined" data frame.
* Implemented Concourse Pipelines (3 Pivots)
* Re-platformed micro-services on PAS
* Re-platformed to MySQL data stores
* Updated mobile app to accomodate ML guidance.   
* **BHAG** - Deploy PF2.0 to Apple Store

# CI/CD review and update

Kenny Sabarese


## Current Setup
* Individual pipelines created for 3 batch microservices
    - **DataFreshAnt** and **AnalyticsAnt** include tasks to run manual jobs, **MachineLearningAnt** does not
* Task to execute batch job
* Dataflow pipeline created to execute the batch jobs
    - Execute **DataFreshAnt** first, on completion execute analytics and ML in parallel
* Current status
    - Datafresh ready
    - **AnalyticsAnt** and **MachineLearningAnt** tasks to be tested and tweaked

## Open Questions
* Does a code commit automatically kick off a build? 
    - No. Only if you set "trigger: true" 
* Can we modify a task in github without kicking off a build? 
    - Seems everything we have tried has not worked

## Actions
* Finish and test **AnalyticsAnt** task
* Finish and test **MachineLearningAnt** task
* Schedule setup
* Change datafresh to command line push for staging setting? 
* Documentation?
