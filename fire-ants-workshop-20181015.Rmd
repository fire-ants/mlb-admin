## Pitchers Friend 2.0 Goal 1
**Technical - Deploy PF2.0 using PAS, PKS, and / or PFS**
 
We currently use GitHub, Docker, Digital Ocean, mLab, redis, SQLite, and an internal free version of PWS for our development platform.

We are polyglot in our our backgrounds and preferred languages.  We currently develop in React Native, R, python, node, and Java Spring.  

Our cloud-native understanding is pretty good considering most of us do not have a formal agile development background – and feel we are only scratching the surface of what is possible.
  
## Pitchers Friend 2.0 Goal 2
**Aspirational – Tell the story of our own “transformation”**
 
Evangelize!!  We would love to be able to share the transformation journey via our site (http://www.fireants.io) as well as our transformation talk-tracks.  We already tell the story to our customers, but the 2.0 version would be even better. 

*“It took us 24 months to get going with DIY, but only 2 weeks with Pivotal!”*  
 
## Pitchers Friend 2.0 Goal 3
**Organizational -  Observe and learn Extreme Agile Programming**
 
We run backlogs, sprints, scrums, and retrospectives…but our pipeline needs polishing.  A little mentorship and guidance  would go a long way.
