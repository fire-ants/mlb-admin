```{r eval=FALSE}
scrape(start = "2016-04-03", end = "2016-11-02", suffix = "inning/inning_all.xml", connect = my_db1$con)
pitch16 <- select(tbl(my_db1, "pitch"), gameday_link, num, des, type, tfs, tfs_zulu, id, sz_top, sz_bot, px, pz, pitch_type, count)
atbat16 <- select(tbl(my_db1, "atbat"), gameday_link, num, pitcher, batter, b_height, pitcher_name, p_throws, batter_name, stand, atbat_des, event, inning, inning_side)
batsTrout <- filter(atbat16, batter == "545361")
pitchesTrout <- collect(inner_join(pitch16, batsTrout))

joined <- pitchesTrout %>% mutate(quant_score_des = get_quant_score(des),
                                   fix_quant_score = fix_quant_score(event) * (des == 'In play, run(s)'),
                                   quant_score = quant_score_des + fix_quant_score,
                                   qual_score = get_qual_score(atbat_des) * (type == 'X'),
                                   hitter_val = quant_score + qual_score)
