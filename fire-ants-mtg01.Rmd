## People
Start with “who?” before we focus on “what?”.

- **[Dan Cohen](https://github.com/dancohen21)**
- **[Brian Moran](https://github.com/brianmoranOK)**
- **[Aaron Sweers](https://github.com/asweers)**
- **[Jason Battles](https://github.com/jrbattles/)**

## Mission
The Mountain Plains Application Development Team (a.k.a ***Fire Ants***) will develop and deploy Cloud Native Applications using modern frameworks to enhance clarity for our customers, our team, and ourselves.

1. Build a Cloud Native Application (Unstructured /Composable and Structured PaaS)
2. Disrupt ourselves to learn new things
3. Develop a new level of relevance

## Organization

- **Consensus** - Team consensus will guide our actions.  
- **Benevolent Military Dictatorship** - If consensus not achieved, then I decide….with love and benevolence in my heart.

## Going Forward

- **Be Here** - We need all the oars in the water.
- **Be Authentic** - Share what you know, think you know, and do not know.
- **Be Loving your Neighbor** - Come alongside and add to the collective knowledge.
- **Be Heard** - This is a safe place.  Ask if you are not clear on something
- **Be Decisive** - 24 hour timeframe.  

## Roles & Skill Categories

Like all high-speed task forces, you have been carefully selected for your skillsets (current and targeted for development).  

- Micro-Service Architecture
- Code Repo - <http://www.github.com>
- Image Repo
- App Dev
- PaaS Architecture
- Scheduling 
- Monitoring
- Database
- Battle Buddies - 2 man teams deployed to tackle complex tasks.  

## Decide on First Project

1. **MLB Hitter Analysis** - good data, unclear objectives
2. **EMC Technology Refresh** - medium quality data, clear objectives, concerns about security
3. **District Calendars** - Publish consolidated Internet calendars. Possible conflict with existing toolsets.
4. **Other Ideas?**

## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown presentation. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document.
